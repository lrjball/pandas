    "This notebook allows you to try out the latest version of pandas from the master branch. It is intended to be launched from binder. Before you raise an issue for a bug, it is a good idea to make sure you can reproduce that bug on the master branch as it may have already been fixed. This live notebook lets you do that without having to install the full pandas environment and dependencies."
